# findutils-chocolatey

A Chocolatey Redistribution of GNU findutils

## GNU with chocolatey

I was inspired by the efforts of [xoviat](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/xoviat) to redistribute GNu packages via chocolatey so I thought to myself:

**Why Not?**

This is based on the same source that [xoviat](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/xoviat) uses.

## Current Status

There was a previous attempt on February 2019 to do this project, but the project was using a different distro that was not tested and required additional compilation.

I was able to remove the previous version using chocolatey's moderators ðŸŽ‰

Currently working on pushing version [4.2.30.5](https://chocolatey.org/packages/findutils/https://chocolatey.org/packages/findutils/4.2.30.5/) to chocolatey

## Install
