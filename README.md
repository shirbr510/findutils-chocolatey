# findutils-chocolatey
![Chocolatey Version](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/v/findutils)

A Chocolatey Redistribution of GNU findutils

## GNU with chocolatey

I was inspired by the efforts of [xoviat](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/xoviat) to redistribute GNu packages via chocolatey so I thought to myself:

**Why Not?**

This is based on the same source that [xoviat](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/xoviat) uses.

## History

 February 2019: There was a previous attempt to do this project, but the project was using a different distro that was not tested and required additional compilation.

February 2020: I was able to remove the previous version using chocolatey's moderators ðŸŽ‰

March 2020: Published Version [4.2.30.5](https://chocolatey.org/packages/findutils/https://chocolatey.org/packages/findutils/4.2.30.5/) ðŸŽ‰
